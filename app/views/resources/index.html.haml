      -# %h3#payment Payment/Rent
      -# %p
      -#   If you wish to rent the space and you’re not a shareholder/investor in Tinkuy, we ask you for a one time deposit of 500dkk.
      
      -# %h5 Regular Therapists
      -# %p
      -#   Therapists who book a fixed number of hours every week, pay the rent at the end of the month based on the income they generated. Meaning, we ask for a minimum of 25dkk/hour. This minimum is set in place to protect our regular therapists in case they don’t have any bookings from their own clients during their regular time slot.  
      -# %p
      -#   However, we ask each therapist to consider setting aside 10% of their asking rate per hour. Example, if you charge 700dkk per session, we ask you to set aside 70dkk for Tinkuy. At the end of the day, based on your number of treated clients and generated income, you can make an estimate of your contribution for the monthly rent.
